Tic-Tac-Toe for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)

This is mainly an exercise for **Factory Functions** and the **Module Pattern**.

I also implemented my first AI, ever. However, I am not using any recursive functions or an implementation of minimax algorithm, meaning the AI can not see k steps ahead, and only do local calculations. I would have think about this more, but given that [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/) has a great implementation already, it would feel like a reinventing the wheel, rather than a worthy challenge.
