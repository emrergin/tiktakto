Tic-Tac-Toe for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe)

This is mainly an exercise for **Factory Functions** and the **Module Pattern**. While I think I got the latter, the project did not need that many objects.

I also implemented my first AI, ever.

However, the solution I personally found was not using any implementation of **minimax algorithm**, meaning the AI will not be able to see *k* steps ahead, and could only do, local calculations to use some heuristic. While it was not bad, it was not perfect, hence I tried to understand the minimax algorithm. During my research, I discovered the great website, [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/) that includes an almost fully working code, and I made sure to fully grasp it before imitating (not copying) the code. This did not feel like reinventing the wheel, more of a learning oppotunity.
